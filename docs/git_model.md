# Git Model

The Git Model categorises files into 3 stages: untracked, staged, and committed.

	1. Untracked

		Untracked files correspond with the Local File storage, and are generally offline files which haven't been uploaded to Git.

	2. Staged

		Staged files belong in the Local repo. Files can be staged by using the command 'git add'. 

	3. Committed

		Committed files are ready to be pulled up to the Remote repo / Origin, but aren't there yet. This is where the 'git pull' cmd comes in handy.


	If you want to upload files to GiHub, then you must undergo this file uploading process.
